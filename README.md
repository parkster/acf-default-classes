# acf-default-classes
This plugin adds a "Default Class List" setting to ACF fields.

Enter the default classes in your ACF Field Group:
Edit Field Group -> Settings -> Group Settings -> Default Class List

On insertion of an ACF block in the Gutenberg editor, the classes will automatically be applied to the Additional CSS Class(es) list.
